# WebhookProxy
A Discord webhook proxy, primarily for Roblox games.

# Why?
Discord banned Roblox from making webhooks again, primarily for abuse purposes. This proxy works around that.

# Our Use
To comply with the proxy Terms of Service, who are working to comply with the Discord Terms of Service, we are rate limtited to 5 requests per 2 seconds. It's unlikely that we will be sending more than 1/2 requests per minute, but please keep this in mind while integrating this proxy.
